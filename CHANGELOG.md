# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Issue #133: Replaced the "N" letter mark with a new dark cyberpunk bicycle logo. The new asset (`frontend/public/tomorrowland-logo-cyber-bike.svg`) features a neon cyan bicycle on a deep navy background with scanline and HUD-bracket accents. Updated the nav rail, login page, and favicon to use the new logo. Added a reusable `TomorrowlandLogo` component at `frontend/src/components/brand/TomorrowlandLogo.tsx`.

### Added
- Polished README and operator documentation for the simplified Tomorrowland air-gapped release artifact flow, split image parts, optional model bundles, and safe upgrade instructions.
- Simplified air-gapped release artifact operator flow. Adds `scripts/tomorrowland-airgap.sh`, a single operator-facing wrapper that supports `validate`, `validate --load-images`, `load-images`, `up`, `status`, `down`, `backup`, `upgrade`, and `help`. The wrapper auto-detects split image parts beside the platform archive (no manual reassembly), delegates to existing lower-level scripts, and hides internal plumbing from operators. The main platform archive remains small and excludes the Docker image tar in split mode; image parts are distributed beside it. Updated `build-release-artifact.sh`, `validate-airgap-artifact.sh`, and `upgrade-airgap.sh` to include the wrapper in the archive, require it in validation, and copy it on upgrade. Updated operator docs to a short copy-pasteable happy-path command sequence. Missing Ollama model bundle remains degraded-only, not a platform startup blocker.

### Fixed
- Issue #139: Fixed frontend/backend document contract drift by normalizing backend entity list responses into the insight UI shape and treating backend `available` translation versions as selectable while pending/running versions remain disabled.
- Issue #114: Air-gapped LibreTranslate image build no longer fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'argostranslate'`. `docker/libretranslate.Dockerfile` now installs pinned `argostranslate==1.9.6` into the system Python before running `install-translation-packs.py`, because the `libretranslate/libretranslate:v1.6.3` base image keeps its Python dependencies in a virtual environment that is not on the `python3` path when executing `RUN` commands as root.

### Added
- Added release and board guardrails to `AGENTS.md` so agents keep RC blockers, release assets, branch freshness, board labels, and handoffs consistent.
- Refactored `AGENTS.md` into a compact, token-efficient guide (~140 lines). Moved coordination templates (claim, transfer, handoff, issue/PR templates) into a new `docs/agents/templates.md`. Updated `docs/agents/token-efficiency.md` and `docs/README.md` to reference the new templates file.
- Issue #127: Split air-gapped release image bundle into GitHub Release-safe part files. The Docker image tar is distributed as `tomorrowland-images-<version>.tar.part-*` beside a small platform archive so each asset stays below the 2 GiB per-file limit. Adds `SPLIT_IMAGE_BUNDLE` / `IMAGE_PART_SIZE` build controls (split mode on by default), `images/README-images.txt` in the platform archive explaining where the parts are, `image_bundle` metadata in `release-manifest.json`, split-part discovery and streaming load in `load-airgap-images.sh`, contiguous-part verification and reconstruction in `validate-airgap-artifact.sh`, workflow upload of all split assets, and `docs/operations/split-airgap-artifacts.md` operator guide. Legacy `SPLIT_IMAGE_BUNDLE=0` embedded mode is preserved.
- Issue #115: Default RC2 Ollama model bundle tooling and docs. Adds connected-host bundle build, air-gapped load, offline model validation/smoke-test scripts, model-bundle-aware platform artifact validation, release workflow upload support for `tomorrowland-ollama-bundle-<model>-<version>.tar.gz`, `.env.airgap.example` model-bundle guidance, and deployment/upgrade/release-note documentation that treats missing model weights as degraded local Q&A/RAG capability rather than platform startup failure.
- Issue #107: Air-gapped translation language pack for English, Hebrew, Chinese Simplified, Korean, Thai, Arabic, French, Russian, and Spanish, bundled into the Docker artifact with validation. Adds a pinned `tomorrowland/libretranslate:airgap` image with Argos Translate packs pre-installed at build time, `SUPPORTED_TRANSLATION_SOURCE/TARGET_LANGUAGES` env config, a `scripts/validate-translation-languages.sh` validation script, and updated air-gapped deployment and upgrade documentation.
- Issue #86: Large list and lazy panel performance — paged history loading, paged document comments in the insight pane, deferred hidden document-panel fetch coverage, and memoized high-churn rows for search results, notifications, and admin sources without backend API or route changes.
- Issue #64: Optional `monitoring` Compose profile with loopback-bound Prometheus/Grafana, tracked Prometheus scrape and alert rules, provisioned Grafana datasource and five starter dashboards, separate monitoring volumes, and unchanged default `docker compose up` behavior.
- Issue #65: NiFi event integration with a typed Kafka event envelope, inline text and staged-file payload normalization, bounded fake-testable Kafka drain, event-level DLQ routing, post-processing/post-DLQ offset commits, source-grant preservation, and deterministic NiFi/Kafka tests without live services.
- Issue #88: Frontend user performance telemetry — privacy-safe in-memory timing diagnostics for login-to-shell, route navigation, search requests/first results, document preview loads, Q&A answers, and admin source sync actions, with opt-in local console inspection and no third-party analytics.
- Issue #83: Hebrew and English UI localization — typed in-repo i18n dictionary (`en`/`he`), `LanguageProvider` context, `LanguageSelector` dropdown in the NavRail and login page, full translation coverage across navigation, login, search, filters, document view, Q&A, comments, annotations, subscriptions, notifications, history, expertise, admin, and command menu. Hebrew switches `document.lang` to `he` and `document.dir` to `rtl`. Selection persists in `localStorage`. Dynamic document content (titles, snippets, usernames) is not translated. English remains the default.
- Refreshed agent coordination docs so Claude, Codex, and human reviewers work from the current issue-based release queue, avoid stale completed missions, and follow tighter context-loading/shared-file conflict guidance.
- Documented host-mounted SMB/CIFS share ingestion through the existing `folder` connector, including read-only host mounts, read-only `api` bind mounts, source setup, security guidance, air-gapped notes, upgrade path stability, and troubleshooting for Issue #78.
- Air-gapped upgrade workflow with read-only preflight checks, fail-closed backup, explicit restore, upgrade orchestration, release manifest safety metadata, and operator documentation that preserves data volumes while loading local images and running migrations.
- Release artifact and air-gapped Compose deployment path with prebuilt image bundling, offline validation/loading scripts, air-gapped environment template, GitHub Actions workflow, and operator runbook for download-to-first-use installs.
- Added an admin-only `/admin/readiness` endpoint with cached dependency probes and Prometheus dependency health metrics.
- Phase 08e UI collaboration and discovery: standalone comments and annotations panels, subscriptions with saved-search conversion, grouped notifications, private history note, neutral expertise map, Cmd/Ctrl+K command menu, and Playwright accessibility smoke coverage.
- Phase 10b domain metrics: Prometheus counters, gauges, and histograms for authentication, authorization, admin actions, ingestion, pipeline stages, search, translation, intelligence, Ollama, RAG, preview, downloads, comments, annotations, subscriptions, and notifications.
- Phase 10a metrics foundation: per-app Prometheus registry, `/metrics` endpoint, default process/GC metrics, `tomorrowland_build_info`, HTTP request counters/histograms, exception metrics, route-template-safe labels, and `X-Request-ID` propagation.
- Phase 08d: Document detail page — MIME-aware PreviewPane (11 typed renderers: Text, HTML with DOMParser XSS sanitization, Table, Archive, Email, Slides, Image, Unsupported, ExtractionFailed, FileMissing, LoadingTimeout), InsightPane tab architecture (Summary, Q&A, Related, Annotations, Comments, Subscriptions), DocumentToolbar (back button, title h1, TrustDisplay quality badge, TranslationVersionSelector, RequestTranslationDialog, download link), QA sub-components (QuestionInput, AnswerPanel, CitationCard, CitationList, QAPanel embeddable), and QAPage refactored to delegate entirely to QAPanel.
- Phase 08c: Main product UI — search workspace (SearchPage with URL-synced `?q=&mode=` params,
  keyboard `/` shortcut, skeleton loading, mode toggle, filter panel, result rows with MIME icon
  and "Why" tooltip), document preview page (split-pane PreviewPane + DetailsPanel with Summary,
  Entities, Tags, Related, Annotations, and Comments tabs, full CRUD for comments and annotations,
  XSS-safe HTML sanitization), Q&A page with answer block and citation links, Subscriptions page
  (create/edit dialog with threshold slider, toggle, delete with confirmation), Notifications page
  (mark-read on click, unread accent), History page (recent views list), live unread count in
  NavRail badge, and frontend CI job (lint + typecheck + test + build).
- Split GitHub Actions into focused backend, frontend, docs, container, and security workflows with path filters, dependency caches, concurrency cancellation, BuildKit caching, and release CD for version tags.
- Metrics and monitoring design plus Phase 10 observability plan covering
  Prometheus metrics, admin readiness, structured logs, dashboards, alerts, and
  future worker observability.
- Phase 08f-5 production audit helper for static production checks, Compose config validation, tracked secret scanning, and opt-in dependency audits.
- Phase 08f-4 smoke bootstrap helper for idempotent admin/group/source fixture setup and path-guarded deterministic document creation inside the API container.
- Phase 08f-3 no-mock Compose smoke test script covering startup, fixture setup, authentication, folder-source ingestion, search, preview, download, frontend reachability, and default volume teardown.
- Phase 08f-2 operations documentation: fully annotated `.env.example` plus expanded production Compose runbook for setup, reset, backup, restore, health checks, and troubleshooting.
- Phase 08f-1 production defaults: configurable CORS origins wired into FastAPI, Compose defaults pinned to the local frontend origin, and tracked JWT examples use production-change placeholders.
- Phase 08f production hardening plan split into five reviewable PRs for production defaults, operations documentation, Compose smoke testing, smoke bootstrap fixtures, and production audit automation.
- Confluence and Jira Server/Data Center connectors that validate non-cloud
  Atlassian URLs, expose admin form schemas, poll pages/issues, normalize
  page/issue text, and download attachments for ingestion.
- Data source connector abstraction — `src/services/connectors/` package with a
  `SourceConnector` protocol, `ConnectorField` for self-describing config schemas,
  `FolderConnector` (extracted from `sync_now`), and `NiFiConnector` stub ready for
  implementation. Adding a new source type now requires one class and one registry entry.
- `GET /admin/connector-types` endpoint returning each connector's field schema
  (label, key, sensitive flag) so the UI can render the correct form dynamically.
- `POST /admin/sources` now accepts and persists a `config` dict for per-source
  credentials and settings (e.g. API tokens, base URLs).
- `PipelineWorker.process_document` accepts optional `pre_extracted_text`, enabling
  API/network connectors that deliver text directly rather than file paths.
- Admin Sources page (`/admin`) — React feature using the Phase 08b design system:
  sources table, Add Source dialog with a form that adapts to the selected connector
  type (sensitive fields masked), inline Sync result display, connection testing,
  sanitized operator-facing errors, and persisted last sync status/count/time.
- Agent efficiency guidance: canonical uppercase `AGENTS.md` plus `frontend/AGENTS.md` with scoped commands, token-saving workflow, and common mistake checklists.
- Phase 08b: Frontend foundation — React 19 + TypeScript + Vite scaffold with
  TanStack Router and Query, React Hook Form + Zod auth form, design-token CSS
  system, primitive component library (Button, IconButton, TextInput,
  SearchInput, Badge, Tabs, Dialog, Skeleton, EmptyState, Toast), AppShell with
  responsive NavRail, API client with 401 session-expiry handling, auth token
  storage boundary, Login page, Playwright config at four viewports, Vitest +
  Testing Library unit tests (18 tests), and multi-stage frontend Dockerfile
  building the React app.
- Phase 08a: Compose runtime foundation — backend ASGI entrypoint, public health
  endpoint, production-oriented API and frontend containers, migration service,
  Compose runtime wiring, and local production operations guide.
- Phase 07e: Related documents and expertise map — backend endpoints for permission-filtered related document surfacing and neutral expertise evidence using Qdrant chunks plus views, comments, shared annotations, and subscriptions.
- Phase 07d: Subscriptions and notifications — `alert_subscriptions` and `alert_notifications` tables, subscription CRUD endpoints, unread notification listing and read marking, `AlertMatcher` with source-permission filtering, ingest-time matching, admin alert trigger, feature flag enforcement, and integration tests.
- Phase 07c: RAG Q&A — `RagService` retrieves chunks from Qdrant, assembles context, calls Ollama, returns answer + citations; `POST /qa` endpoint with `question` and `top_k`; `feature.rag_qa` enforcement; source-grant-aligned ES/Qdrant indexing; best-effort fallback on Ollama failure; mocked Qdrant tests.
- Phase 07b: Annotations — `annotations` table, `AnnotationRepository`, `GET|POST /documents/{doc_id}/annotations`, `PUT|DELETE /annotations/{annotation_id}`, private/shared visibility filtering, hard delete with creator/admin permission checks, JSON position support.
- Phase 07a: Document comments — `document_comments` table, `CommentRepository`, `GET|POST|PATCH|DELETE /documents/{doc_id}/comments`, soft-delete with creator/admin permission checks, pagination and sorting, `feature.document_comments` flag.
- Phase 06: Intelligence layer — `document_summaries`, `entities`, `document_entities`, `document_tags` tables, `IntelligenceWorker` with mocked Ollama client, summarize/extract_entities/auto_tag tasks, `GET /documents/{doc_id}/summary`, `/entities`, `/tags`, `POST /admin/intelligence/{doc_id}/trigger`, wired into `PipelineWorker` after indexing, best-effort failure behavior.
- Phase 05c: Translation versions — `document_translation_versions` table, `GET /documents/{doc_id}/translation-versions`, versioned preview with `?translation_version_id=`, `POST /documents/{doc_id}/translate` creates version records, `SlowWorker` processes pending versions, auto-enrich creates `auto_enrich` version.
- Phase 05b: Translation enrichment — manual request `POST /documents/{doc_id}/translate`, auto-enrich threshold via `document_views` count, `SlowWorker` re-translation/re-indexing, `GET /admin/enrichment-queue`.
- Phase 05a: Preview service — truncated MIME-type-aware snippets, HTML sanitization, archive filename listing, per-user view tracking via `document_views`, `GET /me/activity`.
- Phase 04: Admin operations — users, groups, sources, permissions, config, DLQ retry, activity audit.
- Phase 03e: Search, preview, and download APIs with permission filtering and path-traversal guards.
- Phase 03d: Worker pipeline — synchronous ingestion with extraction, translation, chunking, embedding, indexing.
- Phase 03c: Search infrastructure — Elasticsearch + Qdrant clients, mock encoder, hybrid merger.
- Phase 03b: LibreTranslate client with fallback and token-based chunking (sentence-aware).
- Phase 03a: Document persistence and text extraction (15 file types).
- Phase 02: Authentication, JWT, LDAP boundary, and permission enforcement.
- Phase 01: Foundation schema, shared contracts, service skeletons, and tests.
- Phase 00: Planning, repository hygiene, and GitHub Actions bootstrap.
- SMB source connector MVP using `smbprotocol`/`smbclient` service-account username/password authentication, source type registration, migrations for `smb` source/document constraints, and operational docs that call out NTFS ACL, Kerberos, and DFS limitations.

### Changed
- Documentation now reflects that Confluence and Jira Server/Data Center polling
  connectors are implemented; Phase 09 only retains NiFi, legacy Office, Kafka,
  and optional Atlassian hardening follow-ups.

### Fixed
- Frontend collaboration/discovery API clients now match backend comments, annotations, and expertise wire formats.
- `services/health.py` now uses `typing_extensions.TypedDict` for Python 3.11
  compatibility (Pydantic 2 rejected `typing.TypedDict` on Python < 3.12).
- Frontend admin sources integration now passes lint/build checks with type-only
  imports, matching primitive props, and a Fast Refresh-safe toast context split.
- Connector metadata from `ConnectorDocument.metadata` is now persisted into `documents.metadata` during admin-triggered syncs.

### Planned
- Phase 08: Productization, UI, and production Compose.
- Phase 09: Optional integrations and legacy format support, including NiFi,
  optional Atlassian hardening, old Office extraction, and nonessential Kafka
  consumer wiring.
