# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Refreshed agent coordination docs so Claude, Codex, and human reviewers work from the current issue-based release queue, avoid stale completed missions, and follow tighter context-loading/shared-file conflict guidance.
- Documented host-mounted SMB/CIFS share ingestion through the existing `folder` connector, including read-only host mounts, read-only `api` bind mounts, source setup, security guidance, air-gapped notes, upgrade path stability, and troubleshooting for Issue #78.
- Air-gapped upgrade workflow with read-only preflight checks, fail-closed backup, explicit restore, upgrade orchestration, release manifest safety metadata, and operator documentation that preserves data volumes while loading local images and running migrations.
- Release artifact and air-gapped Compose deployment path with prebuilt image bundling, offline validation/loading scripts, air-gapped environment template, GitHub Actions workflow, and operator runbook for download-to-first-use installs.
- Added an admin-only `/admin/readiness` endpoint with cached dependency probes and Prometheus dependency health metrics.
- Phase 08e UI collaboration and discovery: standalone comments and annotations panels, subscriptions with saved-search conversion, grouped notifications, private history note, neutral expertise map, Cmd/Ctrl+K command menu, and Playwright accessibility smoke coverage.
- Phase 10b domain metrics: Prometheus counters, gauges, and histograms for authentication, authorization, admin actions, ingestion, pipeline stages, search, translation, intelligence, Ollama, RAG, preview, downloads, comments, annotations, subscriptions, and notifications.
- Phase 10a metrics foundation: per-app Prometheus registry, `/metrics` endpoint, default process/GC metrics, `neverland_build_info`, HTTP request counters/histograms, exception metrics, route-template-safe labels, and `X-Request-ID` propagation.
- Phase 08d: Document detail page — MIME-aware PreviewPane (11 typed renderers: Text, HTML with DOMParser XSS sanitization, Table, Archive, Email, Slides, Image, Unsupported, ExtractionFailed, FileMissing, LoadingTimeout), InsightPane tab architecture (Summary, Q&A, Related, Annotations, Comments, Subscriptions), DocumentToolbar (back button, title h1, TrustDisplay quality badge, TranslationVersionSelector, RequestTranslationDialog, download link), QA sub-components (QuestionInput, AnswerPanel, CitationCard, CitationList, QAPanel embeddable), and QAPage refactored to delegate entirely to QAPanel.
- Phase 08c: Main product UI — search workspace (SearchPage with URL-synced `?q=&mode=` params,
  keyboard `/` shortcut, skeleton loading, mode toggle, filter panel, result rows with MIME icon
  and "Why" tooltip), document preview page (split-pane PreviewPane + DetailsPanel with Summary,
  Entities, Tags, Related, Annotations, and Comments tabs, full CRUD for comments and annotations,
  XSS-safe HTML sanitization), Q&A page with answer block and citation links, Subscriptions page
  (create/edit dialog with threshold slider, toggle, delete with confirmation), Notifications page
  (mark-read on click, unread accent), History page (recent views list), live unread count in
  NavRail badge, and frontend CI job (lint + typecheck + test + build).
- Split GitHub Actions into focused backend, frontend, docs, container, and security workflows with path filters, dependency caches, concurrency cancellation, BuildKit caching, and release CD for version tags.
- Metrics and monitoring design plus Phase 10 observability plan covering
  Prometheus metrics, admin readiness, structured logs, dashboards, alerts, and
  future worker observability.
- Phase 08f-5 production audit helper for static production checks, Compose config validation, tracked secret scanning, and opt-in dependency audits.
- Phase 08f-4 smoke bootstrap helper for idempotent admin/group/source fixture setup and path-guarded deterministic document creation inside the API container.
- Phase 08f-3 no-mock Compose smoke test script covering startup, fixture setup, authentication, folder-source ingestion, search, preview, download, frontend reachability, and default volume teardown.
- Phase 08f-2 operations documentation: fully annotated `.env.example` plus expanded production Compose runbook for setup, reset, backup, restore, health checks, and troubleshooting.
- Phase 08f-1 production defaults: configurable CORS origins wired into FastAPI, Compose defaults pinned to the local frontend origin, and tracked JWT examples use production-change placeholders.
- Phase 08f production hardening plan split into five reviewable PRs for production defaults, operations documentation, Compose smoke testing, smoke bootstrap fixtures, and production audit automation.
- Confluence and Jira Server/Data Center connectors that validate non-cloud
  Atlassian URLs, expose admin form schemas, poll pages/issues, normalize
  page/issue text, and download attachments for ingestion.
- Data source connector abstraction — `src/services/connectors/` package with a
  `SourceConnector` protocol, `ConnectorField` for self-describing config schemas,
  `FolderConnector` (extracted from `sync_now`), and `NiFiConnector` stub ready for
  implementation. Adding a new source type now requires one class and one registry entry.
- `GET /admin/connector-types` endpoint returning each connector's field schema
  (label, key, sensitive flag) so the UI can render the correct form dynamically.
- `POST /admin/sources` now accepts and persists a `config` dict for per-source
  credentials and settings (e.g. API tokens, base URLs).
- `PipelineWorker.process_document` accepts optional `pre_extracted_text`, enabling
  API/network connectors that deliver text directly rather than file paths.
- Admin Sources page (`/admin`) — React feature using the Phase 08b design system:
  sources table, Add Source dialog with a form that adapts to the selected connector
  type (sensitive fields masked), and inline Sync result display.
- Agent efficiency guidance: canonical uppercase `AGENTS.md` plus `frontend/AGENTS.md` with scoped commands, token-saving workflow, and common mistake checklists.
- Phase 08b: Frontend foundation — React 19 + TypeScript + Vite scaffold with
  TanStack Router and Query, React Hook Form + Zod auth form, design-token CSS
  system, primitive component library (Button, IconButton, TextInput,
  SearchInput, Badge, Tabs, Dialog, Skeleton, EmptyState, Toast), AppShell with
  responsive NavRail, API client with 401 session-expiry handling, auth token
  storage boundary, Login page, Playwright config at four viewports, Vitest +
  Testing Library unit tests (18 tests), and multi-stage frontend Dockerfile
  building the React app.
- Phase 08a: Compose runtime foundation — backend ASGI entrypoint, public health
  endpoint, production-oriented API and frontend containers, migration service,
  Compose runtime wiring, and local production operations guide.
- Phase 07e: Related documents and expertise map — backend endpoints for permission-filtered related document surfacing and neutral expertise evidence using Qdrant chunks plus views, comments, shared annotations, and subscriptions.
- Phase 07d: Subscriptions and notifications — `alert_subscriptions` and `alert_notifications` tables, subscription CRUD endpoints, unread notification listing and read marking, `AlertMatcher` with source-permission filtering, ingest-time matching, admin alert trigger, feature flag enforcement, and integration tests.
- Phase 07c: RAG Q&A — `RagService` retrieves chunks from Qdrant, assembles context, calls Ollama, returns answer + citations; `POST /qa` endpoint with `question` and `top_k`; `feature.rag_qa` enforcement; source-grant-aligned ES/Qdrant indexing; best-effort fallback on Ollama failure; mocked Qdrant tests.
- Phase 07b: Annotations — `annotations` table, `AnnotationRepository`, `GET|POST /documents/{doc_id}/annotations`, `PUT|DELETE /annotations/{annotation_id}`, private/shared visibility filtering, hard delete with creator/admin permission checks, JSON position support.
- Phase 07a: Document comments — `document_comments` table, `CommentRepository`, `GET|POST|PATCH|DELETE /documents/{doc_id}/comments`, soft-delete with creator/admin permission checks, pagination and sorting, `feature.document_comments` flag.
- Phase 06: Intelligence layer — `document_summaries`, `entities`, `document_entities`, `document_tags` tables, `IntelligenceWorker` with mocked Ollama client, summarize/extract_entities/auto_tag tasks, `GET /documents/{doc_id}/summary`, `/entities`, `/tags`, `POST /admin/intelligence/{doc_id}/trigger`, wired into `PipelineWorker` after indexing, best-effort failure behavior.
- Phase 05c: Translation versions — `document_translation_versions` table, `GET /documents/{doc_id}/translation-versions`, versioned preview with `?translation_version_id=`, `POST /documents/{doc_id}/translate` creates version records, `SlowWorker` processes pending versions, auto-enrich creates `auto_enrich` version.
- Phase 05b: Translation enrichment — manual request `POST /documents/{doc_id}/translate`, auto-enrich threshold via `document_views` count, `SlowWorker` re-translation/re-indexing, `GET /admin/enrichment-queue`.
- Phase 05a: Preview service — truncated MIME-type-aware snippets, HTML sanitization, archive filename listing, per-user view tracking via `document_views`, `GET /me/activity`.
- Phase 04: Admin operations — users, groups, sources, permissions, config, DLQ retry, activity audit.
- Phase 03e: Search, preview, and download APIs with permission filtering and path-traversal guards.
- Phase 03d: Worker pipeline — synchronous ingestion with extraction, translation, chunking, embedding, indexing.
- Phase 03c: Search infrastructure — Elasticsearch + Qdrant clients, mock encoder, hybrid merger.
- Phase 03b: LibreTranslate client with fallback and token-based chunking (sentence-aware).
- Phase 03a: Document persistence and text extraction (15 file types).
- Phase 02: Authentication, JWT, LDAP boundary, and permission enforcement.
- Phase 01: Foundation schema, shared contracts, service skeletons, and tests.
- Phase 00: Planning, repository hygiene, and GitHub Actions bootstrap.
- SMB source connector MVP using `smbprotocol`/`smbclient` service-account username/password authentication, source type registration, migrations for `smb` source/document constraints, and operational docs that call out NTFS ACL, Kerberos, and DFS limitations.

### Changed
- Documentation now reflects that Confluence and Jira Server/Data Center polling
  connectors are implemented; Phase 09 only retains NiFi, legacy Office, Kafka,
  and optional Atlassian hardening follow-ups.

### Fixed
- Frontend collaboration/discovery API clients now match backend comments, annotations, and expertise wire formats.
- `services/health.py` now uses `typing_extensions.TypedDict` for Python 3.11
  compatibility (Pydantic 2 rejected `typing.TypedDict` on Python < 3.12).
- Frontend admin sources integration now passes lint/build checks with type-only
  imports, matching primitive props, and a Fast Refresh-safe toast context split.
- Connector metadata from `ConnectorDocument.metadata` is now persisted into `documents.metadata` during admin-triggered syncs.

### Planned
- Phase 08: Productization, UI, and production Compose.
- Phase 09: Optional integrations and legacy format support, including NiFi,
  optional Atlassian hardening, old Office extraction, and nonessential Kafka
  consumer wiring.
