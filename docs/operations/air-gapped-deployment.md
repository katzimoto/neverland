# Air-Gapped Compose Deployment

This guide describes the release artifact path for installing Neverland on a
host that cannot reach the internet. The artifact contains the Compose files,
operator templates, validation scripts, documentation, checksums, and a Docker
image bundle with every first-party and third-party runtime image needed by the
default Compose deployment.

## Artifact Layout

A release archive is named `neverland-release-<version>.tar.gz` and extracts to:

```text
neverland-release-<version>/
  docker-compose.yml
  docker-compose.airgap.yml
  .env.airgap.example
  images/
    neverland-images.tar
  scripts/
    load-airgap-images.sh
    validate-airgap-artifact.sh
  docs/
    air-gapped-deployment.md
    production-compose.md
  checksums.txt
  README-airgap.txt
```

Use `docker-compose.airgap.yml` for offline hosts. It contains only `image:`
references and does not require Docker builds. The root `docker-compose.yml` is
included for source traceability and connected environments that intentionally
build from source.

## Download And Transfer

1. From a connected workstation, download the archive from one of these release
   paths:
   - the `release-artifact` GitHub Actions workflow artifact for a manually
     triggered run; or
   - the GitHub Release assets for a `v*` tag when a tagged release is created.
2. Download the matching `neverland-release-<version>.tar.gz.sha256` file.
3. Verify the archive checksum before transfer:

   ```bash
   sha256sum -c neverland-release-<version>.tar.gz.sha256
   ```

4. Copy the verified `.tar.gz` file to the air-gapped host using approved
   removable media or an approved transfer gateway.

## Host Prerequisites

Install these prerequisites on the air-gapped host before extracting the
artifact:

- Docker Engine 24 or newer.
- Docker Compose plugin 2.20 or newer.
- Enough local disk for the image bundle, extracted images, named volumes,
  Elasticsearch/Qdrant indexes, uploaded files, translation cache, and Ollama
  model cache.
- Host firewall rules that expose only the intended frontend port. The
  air-gapped compose file binds the direct API port and infrastructure ports to
  `127.0.0.1` by default; browser API traffic should normally flow through the
  frontend proxy.

Confirm versions:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## Extract And Validate The Artifact

Extract the archive and validate the packaged files:

```bash
tar xzf neverland-release-<version>.tar.gz
cd neverland-release-<version>
sha256sum -c checksums.txt
bash scripts/validate-airgap-artifact.sh .
```

The validation script fails if required files are missing, checksums do not
match, Compose cannot render the air-gapped file, a `build:` step appears in the
air-gapped Compose path, or a referenced image is not present in
`images/neverland-images.tar`.

## Load Images

Load the bundled Docker images:

```bash
bash scripts/load-airgap-images.sh .
```

Optionally re-run validation against the local Docker daemon:

```bash
bash scripts/validate-airgap-artifact.sh --load-images .
```

You can also inspect the required image list:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.airgap.example -f docker-compose.airgap.yml config --images
```

## Configure Environment

Create the runtime environment file:

```bash
cp .env.airgap.example .env
```

Edit `.env` before starting the product. At minimum:

- Replace `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` with a strong password.
- Update `POSTGRES_URL` so the password, user, host, port, and database match
  `POSTGRES_*`; the default service host remains `postgres`.
- Replace `JWT_SECRET` with a long random value and keep it stable after users
  are created.
- Confirm `FILES_ROOT=/data` unless you intentionally change the container
  storage path.
- Set `CORS_ORIGINS` to the exact browser origin, such as
  `http://neverland.example.local:8080`; do not use a wildcard.
- Set `API_PORT` and `FRONTEND_PORT` for the host ports operators should reach.
- Leave the direct API and infrastructure ports bound to localhost unless a
  maintenance workflow explicitly requires host access. Put any public access
  behind an approved reverse proxy and access control boundary.

The template contains placeholders only. Do not put real secrets back into the
release archive or commit them to source control.

## Configure Source Connectors

Source definitions are created after login from the admin UI or admin API. Store
connector credentials in the Neverland source configuration, not in the release
artifact.

### Folder Connector

The air-gapped compose file mounts a host folder into the API and migration
containers:

```env
NEVERLAND_FOLDER_SOURCE_HOST_PATH=./operator-data/folder-source
NEVERLAND_FOLDER_SOURCE_CONTAINER_PATH=/sources/folder
```

Create the host directory and copy source documents into it:

```bash
mkdir -p operator-data/folder-source
```

When adding a folder source in Neverland, use the container path from `.env`, for
example `/sources/folder`. Do not use the host path in the source definition;
the API runs inside the container.

### Confluence Server/Data Center

Add a Confluence source with:

- `base_url`, for example `https://wiki.local`.
- `username`, if the server requires basic authentication.
- `api_token` or password, stored as a sensitive source field.
- Optional `space_key` to limit sync scope.
- Optional `updated_since` to limit initial polling.

The connector is intended for Confluence Server/Data Center URLs reachable from
the air-gapped Docker network or host routing environment. Atlassian Cloud is not
the target deployment for this connector.

### Jira Server/Data Center

Add a Jira source with:

- `base_url`, for example `https://jira.local`.
- `username`, if the server requires basic authentication.
- `api_token` or password, stored as a sensitive source field.
- Optional `project_key`, `jql`, or `updated_since` to limit sync scope.

Confluence and Jira Server/Data Center connectors are implemented, but
Atlassian-native permission synchronization is not yet included. Use Neverland
source grants, groups, and permissions to control access to synced documents.

### NiFi

NiFi is currently a registered connector stub. The admin form exposes `base_url`,
`flow_id`, and `api_token`, but document fetching is not production-ready in the
current release. Do not depend on NiFi for an air-gapped production rollout until
a follow-up implementation completes the connector.

## Configure Local Users, Groups, And LDAP

Set `AUTH_PROVIDER` in `.env`:

- `local`: local users created by an admin can log in.
- `ldap`: LDAP credentials are accepted; local-password login is disabled.
- `both`: local and LDAP login are both available.

For local users and groups, log in as an administrator and use the admin screens
or admin API to:

1. Create groups.
2. Create local users with temporary passwords.
3. Mark the appropriate users as administrators.
4. Grant groups access to sources/documents according to your operating model.

For LDAP, configure:

```env
AUTH_PROVIDER=ldap
LDAP_URL=ldap://domain-controller:389
LDAP_BASE_DN=DC=company,DC=local
LDAP_BIND_USER=cn=svc-search,DC=company,DC=local
LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD=change-me-ldap-bind-password
```

LDAP users authenticate against the configured directory. Group behavior depends
on the current Neverland auth boundary and configured/admin-created Neverland
groups; verify expected membership and access with a non-admin test account
before loading sensitive corpora.

## Start Neverland

Render the final Compose configuration:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.airgap.yml config
```

Start in the background:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.airgap.yml up -d
```

Check service state and logs:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.airgap.yml ps
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.airgap.yml logs -f api frontend migrate
```

Health checks from the host:

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/admin/readiness
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/health
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

Open the frontend at `http://localhost:8080` or the host/port you configured in
`.env`.

## First Admin Checklist

After the stack is healthy:

1. Log in as an administrator.
2. Create or configure local users, or verify LDAP login if LDAP is enabled.
3. Create groups and assign permissions.
4. Add a source: folder, Confluence Server/Data Center, or Jira Server/Data
   Center.
5. Sync the source.
6. Search for synced content.
7. Open a document preview.
8. Ask a Q&A question if RAG is enabled and the Ollama model is available.
9. Add a comment or annotation if those feature flags remain enabled.
10. Review `/admin/readiness` and service logs for degraded dependencies.

## Stop, Reset, Backup, And Restore

Stop without deleting data:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.airgap.yml down
```

Reset all named volumes, deleting metadata, files, indexes, caches, and Kafka
data:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.airgap.yml down -v
```

Back up `postgres_data`, `files_data`, `elasticsearch_data`, and `qdrant_data`
together while the stack is stopped, or from a storage snapshot that captures
them at the same point in time. Keep a logical PostgreSQL dump with volume
backups when possible. See `docs/production-compose.md` for detailed volume copy
commands and restore sequencing.

Restore all consistency-sensitive volumes from the same backup set. Do not mix a
PostgreSQL backup from one point in time with Elasticsearch or Qdrant indexes
from another unless you are prepared to rebuild indexes.

## Current Limitations

- The default artifact does not include pre-downloaded Ollama model weights.
  If the configured model is not already present in `ollama_data`, transfer an
  approved model bundle separately or load it during a connected staging step
  before moving the volume into the air-gapped environment.
- Long-running worker containers are not part of the current Compose runtime.
- NiFi connector fetching is not production-ready.
- Atlassian-native permission synchronization is not present; use Neverland
  source grants and groups.
