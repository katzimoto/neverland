# Implementation Plan Index

Implementation is split into reviewable phases. Each phase should be developed
on its own branch and reviewed before the next phase starts.

## Rules

- One phase equals one PR unless explicitly split into smaller PRs.
- Do not push directly to `main`.
- Preserve `spec.md` and `spec-v4.pdf` as source references.
- Use `agents.md` for Developer and Reviewer agent responsibilities.
- Use `skill.md` for TDD, linting, documentation, and coverage expectations.
- Resolve phase blockers in `docs/review/spec-gaps.md` before coding the phase.

## What to work on next

See `AGENTS.md ## Mission queue` for the prioritized list of available missions with branch
names and parallel-safety flags. Do not start a phase from this table without checking the
queue first.

## Review Gate

At the end of each phase, the Developer agent stops after validation. The
Reviewer agent audits correctness, coverage, docs, security, and style before
the next phase begins.
