# Frontend UI Implementation Plan

## Goal

Build the user-facing Neverland interface described in
`docs/design/user-ui-spec.md` as reviewable frontend phases. The UI should feel
native on first use: search-first, fast, dense-but-clear, accessible, and
grounded in source documents.

## Source Specs

- `docs/design/user-ui-spec.md`
- `docs/design/document-comments-spec.md`
- `docs/design/translation-versions-spec.md`
- `docs/logical-spec.md`
- `docs/implementation/phase-03e-search-apis.md`
- `docs/implementation/phase-05-preview-enrichment.md`
- `docs/implementation/phase-05c-translation-versions.md`
- `docs/implementation/phase-07a-document-comments.md`
- `docs/implementation/phase-07-rag-ui-features.md`

## Chosen Stack

Use this stack for the first production UI implementation. Do not introduce a
parallel routing, styling, or state framework without updating this plan first.

- React + TypeScript.
- Vite for local development and build.
- TanStack Query for API state, caching, loading states, and retries.
- TanStack Router for typed route-level navigation and URL search params.
- React Hook Form plus Zod for forms and request validation.
- Lucide icons for icon buttons and navigation.
- CSS modules backed by global `tokens.css`, `base.css`, and `utilities.css`.
  Avoid Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, and heavy component frameworks for the MVP.
- Vitest and Testing Library for unit/component tests.
- Playwright for browser workflow, responsive layout, and screenshot checks.
- axe-based accessibility checks through Playwright or Testing Library.

Design principle: build a small Neverland design system first, then compose
pages from it. Do not style each page independently.

```

## Phase 08 Alignment

Frontend work is now part of Phase 08. The first UI PR should be
`developer/phase-08b-frontend-foundation`, after the Compose runtime foundation
exists. UI phases remain reviewable slices, but they should target the
production Compose product milestone rather than a standalone UI track.

## API Availability Map

Classify API usage before each UI phase starts.

| Surface | Backend State | UI Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Auth login/me/logout | Available from Phase 02 | Use real API |
| Search | Available from Phase 03e | Use real API |
| Preview metadata/basic preview | Phase 03e, expanded in Phase 05 | Use real API and feature-detect preview mode fields |
| Download | Available from Phase 03e | Use real API |
| Translation versions/manual request | Phase 05c | Use selector when versions exist; hide request when disabled |
| Q&A | Available from Phase 07c | Use real API |
| Annotations | Available from Phase 07b | Use real API |
| Document comments | Available from Phase 07a | Use real API |
| Saved searches | No backend in current phases | Store locally by user ID in browser storage for MVP |
| Subscriptions | Available from Phase 07d | Use real API |
| Notifications | Available from Phase 07d | Use real API |
| History | Partial backend activity APIs exist | Use available activity endpoints; keep unsupported history rows hidden |
| Expertise map | Available from Phase 07e | Use real API |
| Admin | Phase 04 and separate admin UI spec | Link only in user shell |

Do not use ad hoc mocks inside production UI code. If a backend endpoint is not
available, hide the feature, show a disabled state, or use a development-only
fixture adapter behind an explicit flag.

## Auth UX Contract

Authentication is part of the UI foundation, not a page-specific concern.

- `/login` is the only public app route in the MVP.
- Protected routes wait for `/auth/me` before rendering navigation or document
  data.
- While the current user is loading, show a centered app loading state or shell
  skeleton with no protected content.
- Store the bearer token behind a small auth storage boundary using
  `sessionStorage` for the MVP. Do not read or write storage directly from
  feature components.
- Attach `Authorization: Bearer <token>` through the API client only.
- On login success, route to the requested return URL when safe, otherwise
  `/search`.
- On invalid credentials, show: `Email or password is incorrect.`
- On any authenticated API `401`, clear the token and route to
  `/login?expired=1` with copy: `Your session expired. Sign in again.`
- Logout calls `/auth/logout` when available, clears local auth state even if
  the request fails, and returns to `/login`.
- `403` responses render a permission state without leaking source names,
  hidden counts, or document titles.
- Admin navigation is visible only when the current user payload marks the user
  as an admin.

## UI Phase 00: Scaffold And Design System

## UI Phase 01: Auth And Search Workspace

Branch: `developer/phase-08c-search-workspace`

### Scope

- Login flow using real auth endpoints.

- Result rows with title, snippet/chunk text, source/type metadata, tags, score,
  translation state, and result actions.
- Filter panel with UI state for source, file type, date, tags, language, and
  translation. Only send filters that backend supports; keep unsupported filters
  disabled or local-only until API support lands.
- Loading, empty, error, and no-access-safe states.
- Saved search UI using local browser persistence scoped to current user ID.

### Validation

- Component tests for SearchInput, filters, result rows, empty/error states.

  logout, and expired-session redirect.
- Screenshot checks at 320 x 720, 768 x 1024, 1024 x 768, and 1440 x 900.
- Accessibility: result count announcement and focus preservation after filters.

### Acceptance Criteria

- First screen after login is search.
- Search state is reflected in URL query params.
- Protected routes never flash private content before `/auth/me` resolves.
- Permission-filtered zero results do not reveal hidden source names or counts.
- Loading states reserve stable row heights.

## Cross-Phase Design System Rules

- Use lucide icons for actions where available.
- Prefer icon buttons for common commands: download, clear, close, copy, mark
  read, request translation.
- Every icon-only button has a tooltip and accessible name.
- Cards are only for repeated result items, dialogs, and genuinely framed tools.
- Do not nest cards inside cards.
- Avoid decorative orbs, bokeh, gradients, or marketing composition.
- Text must not overlap at 320 px, 768 px, 1024 px, or 1440 px widths.
- Loading states preserve final layout dimensions.
- Empty states include a next action when one is available.
- Permission filtering never reveals inaccessible document names, source names,
  or counts.

## Review Artifacts Per UI PR

Each frontend PR should include:

- Screenshots or Playwright trace links for changed routes at 320 x 720,
  768 x 1024, 1024 x 768, and 1440 x 900.
- Keyboard navigation notes.
- Accessibility check results.
- Viewport validation notes covering clipping, overlap, horizontal scroll, focus
  visibility, and whether the primary action remains reachable.
- Visual regression results. Once screenshot baselines exist, unexpected pixel
  diffs above 0.5% require reviewer sign-off.
- API contract notes listing real, disabled, or fixture-backed endpoints.
- Auth/session behavior notes when protected routes, API client code, or shell
  navigation changes.
- Updated docs when UI behavior changes from this plan.

## Global Validation Commands

Expected frontend commands after UI Phase 00:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend run lint
npm --prefix frontend run typecheck
npm --prefix frontend run test
npm --prefix frontend run build
npm --prefix frontend run test:e2e
```

Expected repository commands:

```bash
uv run --extra dev ruff check .
uv run --extra dev ruff format --check .
uv run --extra dev mypy src --strict
uv run --extra dev pytest
docker compose config
```

## Do Not Start Criteria

Do not begin a UI phase if:

- Required backend endpoints are ambiguous and no disabled-state plan exists.
- The previous UI phase has unresolved Reviewer blockers.
- The route would require revealing inaccessible document metadata.
- The feature depends on a backend phase that has not defined a stable response
  contract.
